#Example

This is a simple bit of code that I cross compiled under Haiku using ht eold BeOS PPC x86 cross 
compiler tools.

* test.c - the source (it really is super simple). Compile with : mwccppc -o test.c
* test.o - the object file as it came from the compiler. BeOS PPC uses the MWOB format for object files. Mac doesn't, and you need to specifically make a library to get one of these.
* test.o.dump.txt - this is the output generated by calling : mwdisppc test.o
